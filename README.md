# 👋 Hi, I’m Nathan Allen

Python backend developer with 20+ years of technical problem-solving experience across IT support, databases, cloud infrastructure, and production Python systems.

I specialize in **clear, maintainable backend code**, strong debugging, and building systems that are reliable before they are clever.

---

## 🧭 What I Do

- 🐍 Build **Python backend services** (FastAPI, Flask, Django)
- 🔌 Design and maintain **REST APIs**
- 🗄️ Work with **SQL-backed systems** (Postgres, MS-SQL, MySQL)
- ☁️ Support and troubleshoot **AWS workloads** (S3, EC2, CloudWatch, Lambda, RDS)
- 🧪 Write **tests and documentation** that make systems survivable

I’m most comfortable working **close to the data and the business logic**, where correctness and clarity matter.

## 🧠 How I Think

- 🧩 Methodical, calm, correctness-focused
- 🛠️ Strong at debugging messy or under-documented systems
- 📖 Documentation is a feature, not an afterthought

## 🤖 AI + Development

I use tools like ChatGPT and Cursor to **accelerate thinking**, not replace it.

Principles:
- I review and understand all generated code
- I keep architectural ownership human
- I optimize for long-term maintainability
