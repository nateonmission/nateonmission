### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Nate Allen and I'm a software developer and technologist! I've been playing with computers since I was 8 years old, when I got a Commodor64 for Christmas! Over the years, I've seen many changes and have enjoyed the ride as technology has transformed our World and conventions come and go.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in Python, Vue, AWS (S3, EC2, Kenesis, etc)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all the things in/on/around AWS. Working towards my Certs.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my kiddos... I can talk for hours LOL
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nateonmission on most social media
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: yea, repeating nouns is tedious (he/him in English)
- âš¡ Fun fact: INTJ (MyersBriggs) / 5 (Enneagram)
